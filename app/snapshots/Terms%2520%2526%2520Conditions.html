    <div common-mark="page.content" id="page-content" class="col-sm-8 ng-isolate-scope"><p>By placing an order from this site, you are agreeing to the Terms and Conditions as listed below. These Terms &amp; Conditions may be updated from time to time to reflect current legislation, and it is suggested to read them carefully.</p>
<h4>Orders</h4>
<p>Please add your items to the basket and fill in the attached form with your details.</p>
<p>When ordering, please provide full name and shipping address, email address and telephone number.</p>
<p>Once an order has been received, a confirmation email will be sent listing the items in your order, the items will be packed, and the postage cost confirmed, based on total weight at prices ruling at that time, before I submit an invoice for payment.</p>
<h4>Overseas Orders</h4>
<p>Once confirmed, your order will be packed and postage will be confirmed with the Post Office before I submit an invoice for payment. Once payment has been cleared, your order will be shipped the next working day.</p>
<p>For orders from the USA, please ensure you have a PayPal account.</p>
<h4>Payment</h4>
<p>I can only accept payment through 'PayPal'.  This is one of the safest methods of online  payment.</p>
<p>When your order is ready, I will send you an request for payment through PayPal to the email address you have supplied.</p>
<h4>Cancellations</h4>
<p>As a consumer, you have the right to cancel the order up to the expiry of seven working days after the day of receipt of the goods. Should you need to cancel the order during this period, you are requested to do this in writing by email to battlescenedesigns@hotmail.co.uk</p>
<h4>Returns</h4>
<p>It is normally policy not to accept any returns unless the goods are 'defective' or have been incorrectly shipped. In these cases, please notify me at battlescenedesigns@hotmail.co.uk within seven working days of receipt of the goods, and I will arrange return/replacement.</p>
<h4>VAT</h4>
<p>I do not charge VAT on orders. The prices shown on the price list is the price you pay, plus the relevant postage cost, which will be calculated on the overall package weight at the prices ruling on that day..</p>
<h4>Shipping</h4>
<p>Shipping method is at my discretion, but under normal circumstances I ship by Royal Mail, First Class post.</p>
<p>I generate my shipping information from the information you provide, so please ensure you provide full and correct name and address details.</p>
<p>If a package is returned to me due to incorrect postal information being supplied, I reserve the right to charge for the additional shipping to have the order re-posted, and I cannot be held responsible for any lost package that was incorrectly addressed based on the information you provide. If the package is returned to me due an error on my part, I will gladly re-post at my own cost.</p>
<p>Once payment has been cleared, I am normally able to ship your order within 5 - 10 working days.</p>
<p>Please note there may be the occasional production delay which may result in an extra day or two to ship your order. If there is likely to be a delay in shipping your order, I will advise you by email at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<h4>Liability</h4>
<p>Each resin model is individually handmade and is made to the highest possible standard I can produce, however, please note the models are by no means perfect, and some level of minor touching up with a product like Milliput may be necessary, it should also be remembered that polyester resin is a brittle and delicate material when thicknesses are at their minimum, therefore, I cannot guarantee that all small parts will remain in place.</p>
<p>MDF buildings will require glueing together.  This can be achieved using either PVA or super glue.   They may also sometimes need a wipe down with a slightly damp cloth to take off any 'scorching' left by the laser, however, this usually is not needed and can be primed and painted straight from the bag.</p>
<p>For shipping resin models, I normally pack each building individually in bubble-wrap and try to ensure that the final packaging is strong enough for the purpose. But please note I cannot accept any liability for the manhandling of the postal service or any damage occurring because of postal service or inspection by customs and excise.</p>
<p>While I am happy to provide advice about my models, please note it is your responsibility to satisfy yourself that the item(s) you are ordering is/are suitable for your needs.</p>
<p>The images on the site may vary from the actual production model as I use 'work in progress' images, which may be updated as production of the model progresses. Though every care is taken to ensure the site is kept up to date, there may be times when the description of an item, or image varies from the actual production model.</p>
